Description:

 - clustering.R / clustering_unscaled.R was used to load data and cluster it using FlowSOM & ConsensusClusterPlus
 - ks_emd.py uses the clustering output to compute cluster-marker scores with Kolmogorow-Smirnov Statistic / Earth-Movers Distance
 - annotation.ipynb computes cell type scores based on marker scores and assigns cell types (the notebook also provides plotting functions)
